# Mercuryx86.exe-Payloads
You can run it on your PC It's safe  
I recommend that you do not run them all at the same time as it will be difficult for you to finish the processes  
don't go making the mistake that I did of executing all of them at the same time send the PC to the floor ok no.
just restart it
